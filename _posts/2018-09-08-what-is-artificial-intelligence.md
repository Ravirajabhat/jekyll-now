## Vision Intelligence / Computer vision
----

The Vision intelligence or Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer vision) 

### Major tasks / Challenges

- [Image Recognision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision#Recognition)
- [Motion Analsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision#Motion_analysis)
- [Scene reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision#Scene_reconstruction)
- [Image restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision#Image_restoration)

## Voice Inteligence / Natural Language Processing
----

Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)

### Major tasks / Challenges

- [Automatic speech recognition(ASR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition)
- [Natural language understanding(NLU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_understanding)
- [Natural language generation (NLG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation)
- [Text-to-speech(TTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis)


## Robotics
----

In simple words, Robotics is a interdisciplinary field of since that is trying to to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions.[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics)

### Major tasks / Challenges

- [Better Power Spource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics#Power_source)
- [Robotic sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_sensing)
- [Humanâ€“robot interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction)
- [Robot locomotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_locomotion)
